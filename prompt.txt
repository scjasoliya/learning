You are provided with a Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) of a process plant. Your task is to analyze the P&ID from an instrumentation engineering perspective and extract relevant data. Follow the instructions below carefully:

1. P&ID Elements
The diagram includes pipes, instruments, and equipment.
Pipes are represented as lines and are identified by line numbers.
2. Line Number Format
Each line number follows this format:
0743-0002-UW-1"-AF1A0F-FA-V, where:

0743: Plant number (common across all lines)
0002: Line number (mechanical properties like design pressure and temperature are consistent across this line)
UW: Fluid code
1": Pipe size (may appear as 1 1/2 or 1" without inch symbol)
AF1A0F-FA: Pipe class
V: Insulation type
3. Instrumentation Engineering Focus
Key parameters: Fluid code, Pipe size, Pipe class
Changes in fluid code, pipe class, or insulation type are marked with a class break (CL) or line break symbol
Pipe size changes are shown using expander, reducer, branch, or tee
4. Field Instruments
Represented by circle symbols
Tag numbers are inside the circle:
First row: Instrument type
Second row: Loop number
Symbols and types follow ISA standards
Valves (excluding safety valves) with instrument tags are connected to actuators (pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric)
Valve types are symbolized and described (e.g., "pneumatic operated ball valve")
Transmitters (pressure, flow, level) may have special symbols (e.g., remote seal, diaphragm)
5. Annotations and Codes
Look for nearby notes or see detail (SEE DETAIL "B") or size (exmaple 2") or codes such as: FC, FO, FL, FLC, DFC, FDO, TSO, IV, V, VI, etc.
Collect these as Notes
6. Control System Connections
Electrical instruments are connected to control systems via dashed lines
If interlock has S code or ESD text nearby, it is connected to ESD
Closed-loop systems (e.g., PT, PIC, PV) are connected to DCS
Control systems include: DCS, ESD, CCC, FNG, NA
7.  Service Description 
To create the instrument loop service description (, which typically reflects the purpose or function of the instrument in the context of the process (e.g., "Reactor Pressure Control", "Pump Discharge Flow Monitoring")) please analyze the following elements from the P&ID for that instrument 
•	Incoming and outgoing pipe connections
•	Fluid code or fluid name
•	Equipment number
•	Equipment description
These will help define the Service Description for each instrument loop
8. Graph Construction
Create a graph showing pipes and equipment with all associated properties of each line number
Connect field instruments along the path of the graph
If an instrument is installed on equipment, use nozzle connection size as the line number
If installed online, use the standard line number format
8. Instrument Validation
Use only instrument types listed in the provided valid_instrument_type.csv file
9. Output Format
Generate a list in the following format (no additional text):

Tag instrument type, Tag loop number, Instrument description, Service description, Line number, Equipment number, Control system, Notes
